## Some Use Cases
**VirtualGameController** is a drop-in replacement for Apple's _Game Controller_ framework, so it can be easily integrated into existing games, provide protection in case you need to revert to using Apple's framework, and allow for features that go beyond _Game Controller_ but use the MFi profiles.  A single game-side implementation can work with a wide range of controller scenarios.  **VirtualGameController** may be useful for you in the following cases:

- **Developing and supporting software-based controllers.**  Enable your users to use their iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch to control your game, leveraging 3d touch and motion input.  Inputs are flowed through the GCController API (that is, through the MFi profiles) and so your software-based controller will appear as a hardware-based controller.  Easily send information from your game to your software controller (bidirectional communication).  The API for creating a software-based controller is simple and easy-to-use.  
- **Creating a hybrid hardware/software controller using controller forwarding.**  Apple described a feature called "controller forwarding" in a session at WWDC in 2014 (at around _29:00_, [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014-611/](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014-611/)) but as far as I know the feature never emerged. *VirtualGameController* supports controller forwarding in roughly the form described in the session, enabling you to enhance form-fitting hardware controllers with a full profile and motion input.
- **Supporting large numbers of controllers for social games.**  There are no imposed limits on the number of hardware or software controllers that can be used with a game.  The two third-party controller limit on the Apple TV can be exceeded using controller forwarding (bridging), hybrid controllers and software-based controllers. 
- **Creating text-driven games.**  Support for string-based custom inputs makes it easy to create text-oriented games.  Use of dictation is demonstrated in the sample projects.

## Screenshots
The user interfaces in the sample projects are designed for documentation, testing and debugging purposes, rather than for use in games.

## Terminology
* **Peripheral**: A software-based game controller.
* **Central**: Typically a game that supports hardware and software controllers.  The Central utilizes VirtualGameController as a replacement for the Apple Game Controller framework.
* **Bridge**: Acts as a relay between a Peripheral and a Central, and represents a hybrid of the two.  Key use case is "controller forwarding".


## Integration
Platform-specific framework projects are included in the workspace.  A single framework file supports both Peripherals (software-based controllers) and Centrals (that is, your game).

``` swift
import VirtualGameController
```

Note that you currently need to ````import GameController```` as well.

CocoaPods and Carthage support will be forthcoming!

## Using the Sample Projects

A number of sample projects are included that demonstrate the app roles (Peripheral, Bridge and Central) for different platforms (iOS, tvOS, OS X, watchOS), along with projects that demonstrates the use of Objective C and SceneKit.  They are delivered with the framework files *copied* into the project rather than referring to the build product of the framework projects.  To switch to using the build products of the framework file, [follow these instructions from the Wiki](https://github.com/robreuss/VirtualGameController/wiki/Setup-Frameworks-in-Sample-Projects).

Other notes on sample projects:

- To explore using your _Apple Watch_ as a controller, use the __iOS Bridge__ sample, which is setup as a watchOS project.  A watch can interact with the iPhone it is paired to as either a Bridge (forwarding values to some other Central) or as a Central (displaying the game interface directly on the paired iPhone).  Discovery of paired watches is automatic.
- Checking out the SceneKit sample project is a great way to evaluate the motion capabilities of the framework, as well as being fun.  


## Creating a Software-based Peripheral
####Initialization
Note that in the following example, no custom elements or custom mappings are being set.  See elsewhere in this document for a discussion of how those are handled (or see the sample projects). 

``` swift
 VgcManager.startAs(.Peripheral, appIdentifier: "MyAppID", customElements: CustomElements(), customMappings: CustomMappings())
```

The parameter `appIdentifier` is for use with Bonjour and should be a short, unique identifier for your app.
 
A simplified form is available if custom mapping and custom elements are not used:

``` swift
VgcManager.startAs(.Peripheral, appIdentifier: "MyAppID")
```
Documentation of the custom mapping and custom elements functionality is coming soon, although the combination of the sample projects and class files are probably enough for you to get going.

After calling the `startAs` method, the Peripheral may be defined by setting it's `deviceInfo` property.  Doing so is not required as the defaults (shown here) should suffice for most purposes.

``` swift
VgcManager.peripheral.deviceInfo = DeviceInfo(deviceUID: "", vendorName: "", attachedToDevice: false, profileType: .ExtendedGamepad, controllerType: .Software, supportsMotion: true)
```

Pass an empty string to `deviceUID` to have it be created by the system using `NSUUID()` and stored to user defaults.  

Pass an empty string to `vendorName` and the device network name will be used to identify the Peripheral.  

####Finding Central Services

Begin the search for Bridges and Centrals:

``` swift
VgcManager.peripheral.browseForServices()
```
Access the current set of found services:

``` swift
VgcManager.peripheral.availableServices
```

Related notifications - both notifications carry a reference to a VgcService as their payload:

``` swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "foundService:", name: VgcPeripheralFoundService, object: nil)
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "lostService:", name: VgcPeripheralLostService, object: nil)
```
In the simplest implementation, you'll be connecting to the first Central service you find, whereas if you always use a Bridge, you'll be connecting to the first Bridge you find.  In those cases, you'll want to start the search and use the `VgcPeripheralFoundService ` notification to call the `connectToService` method.

If you choose to implement a more complex scenario, where you have multiple Peripherals that connect to either a Bridge or Central, the combination of the above methods and notifications should have you covered.  The sample projects implement this type of flexible scenario.
        
####Connecting to and Disconnecting from a Central
Once a reference to a service (either a Central or Bridge) is obtained, it is passed to the following method:

``` swift
VgcManager.peripheral.connectToService(service)
```

To disconnect from a service:

``` swift
VgcManager.peripheral.disconnectFromService()
```

Related notifications:

``` swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "peripheralDidConnect:", name: VgcPeripheralDidConnectNotification, object: nil)
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "peripheralDidDisconnect:", name: VgcPeripheralDidDisconnectNotification, object: nil)
```

####Sending Values to a Central
An Element class is provided, each instance of which represents a hardware or software controller element.  Sets of elements are made available for each supported profile (Micro Gamepad, Gamepad, Extended Gamepad and Motion).  To send a value to the Central, the value property of the appropriate Element object is set, and the element is passed to the `sendElementState` method.

``` swift
let leftShoulder = VgcManager.elements.leftShoulder
leftShoulder.value = 1.0
VgcManager.peripheral.sendElementState(leftShoulder)
```

####System Messages
The only currently implemented system message relevant to the Peripheral role is a message sent by the Central when it receives an element value from a Peripheral that fails a checksum test.  System messages are enumerated, and the invalid checksum message is of type `.ReceivedInvalidMessage`.  

``` swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "receivedSystemMessage:", name: VgcSystemMessageNotification, object: nil)
```

Example of handling `.ReceivedInvalidMessage`:

``` swift
    let systemMessageTypeRaw = notification.object as! Int
    let systemMessageType = SystemMessages(rawValue: systemMessageTypeRaw)
    if systemMessageType == SystemMessages.ReceivedInvalidMessage {        
		// Do something
    }
```
####<a name="player">Player Index</a>
When a Central assigns a player index, it triggers the following notification which carries the new player index value as a payload:

``` swift
NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter().addObserver(self, selector: "receivedPlayerIndex:", name: VgcNewPlayerIndexNotification, object: nil)
```

####Motion (Accelerometer)
Support for motion updates is contingent on Core Motion support for a given platform (for example, it is not supported on OS X).  The framework should detect it if an attempt is made to start motion updates on an unsupported platform.

Key methods that should be self-explanatory:

``` swift
VgcManager.peripheral.motion.start()
VgcManager.peripheral.motion.stop()

VgcManager.peripheral.motion.enableUserAcceleration = true
VgcManager.peripheral.motion.enableGravity = true
VgcManager.peripheral.motion.enableRotationRate = true
VgcManager.peripheral.motion.enableAttitude = true

VgcManager.peripheral.motion.updateInterval = 1/60

VgcManager.peripheral.motion.enableAdaptiveFilter = true
VgcManager.peripheral.motion.enableLowPassFilter = true
```

It is important for performance reasons to reduce updateInterval as much as you can, and to disable motion inputs that are not used in your game.

## Game Integration 
####GCController Replacement
**VirtualGameController** is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the Apple framework **GameController** (although both frameworks should be included because some **GameController** header references are required):

``` swift
import GameController
```

becomes...

``` swift
import GameController
import VirtualGameController
```

A framework file specific to your targetted platform must be used, and framework files are provided for each platform.

The interface for the controller class **VgcController** is the same as that of **GCController**, and for the most part an existing game can be transitioned by doing a global search that replaces "**GCC**" with "**VgcC**".  There are some exceptions where **GameController** structures are used and these can be left as GC references:

``` swift
GCControllerButtonValueChangedHandler
GCControllerDirectionPadValueChangedHandler
GCControllerElement
GCMicroGamepad
GCGamepad
GCExtendedGamepad
GCMotion
```

If you wish to test integration of the framework, it is proven to work with the Apple [DemoBots](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/samplecode/DemoBots/Introduction/Intro.html) sample project. One limitation is that when using the Apple TV version, you must use the Remote to start the game because of issues related to how *DemoBots* implements [this functionality](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/ServicesDiscovery/Conceptual/GameControllerPG/ControllingInputontvOS/ControllingInputontvOS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013276-CH7-DontLinkElementID_13) (see the last paragraph on that page).

For in-depth instructions on using DemoBots as a test, see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/robreuss/VirtualGameController/wiki/Testing-using-DemoBots), which also provide helpful hints on integrating VirtualGameController with your existing project.

####Central versus Bridge
There are two types of Central app integrations and which result in dramatically different: **Central** and **Bridge**.

A **Central** is exactly what you expect in terms of game integration: your Central is your game and there should only be one implemented at a time.  

A **Bridge** combines the behavior of a Central and a Peripheral; it is a Peripheral in relation to your Central, and it is a Central in relation to your Peripheral(s).  Another name for it would be a *controller forwarder*, because it's primary function is to forward/relay values sent by one or more Peripherals to the Central.  The Peripheral could be a MFi hardware controller, an iCade hardware controller, an *Apple Watch* or a software-based virtual controller (assuming the Bridge is deployed on an iPhone paired to the watch).  If the bridge is implemented on a device with device motion support (an iOS device) the Bridge can extend the capabilities of a Peripheral to include motion support.  For example, a MFi or iCade controller can appear to the Central to implement the motion profile.  

####Extended Functionality
There are two features supported by a Central that exceed the capabilities of the Apple *GameController* framework, and should be used with caution if you want to make reverting to that framework easy:

- Custom elements
- Custom mapping
